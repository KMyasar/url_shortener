# Simple URL Shortener

This is a basic URL shortener application built using Flask and SQLite. It allows users to shorten long URLs into shorter, more manageable links.

## Features

* **URL Shortening:** Takes a long URL as input and generates a unique short code.
* **Redirection:** Redirects users who visit the short URL to the original long URL.
* **Simple Database:** Uses SQLite to store the mapping between short codes and long URLs.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.13
* Flask 

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you have it in one) or simply save the provided Python code as `app.py`.

2.  **Install Flask:**
    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```
3. **Install sqlite3**
	
	***Linux***
	```bash
	sudo apt install sqlite3 	
	```
	  ***Mac***
	```bash
	brew install sqlite3
	```
## Running the Application

1.  Navigate to the directory where you saved `app.py` in your terminal.

2.  Run the Flask development server:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    This will start the server, usually accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## API Endpoints

### `/shorten` (POST)

* **Description:** Takes a long URL and returns a shortened URL.
* **Request Body (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
        "url": "[https://www.example.com/a-very-long-url-that-needs-to-be-shortened](https://www.example.com/a-very-long-url-that-needs-to-be-shortened)"
    }
    ```
* **Response (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
        "short_url": "[http://127.0.0.1:5000/abcdef](http://127.0.0.1:5000/abcdef)"
    }
    ```
    *(Note: The `short_url` will use the actual host and a randomly generated short code.)*
* **Error Responses:**
    * `400 Bad Request`: If the `url` field is missing in the request body.
    * `500 Internal Server Error`: If there is a conflict in generating a unique short code (though unlikely with a reasonable short code length).

### `/<short_code>` (GET)

* **Description:** Redirects to the original long URL associated with the provided short code.
* **Path Parameter:**
    * `<short_code>`: The unique short code generated by the `/shorten` endpoint.
* **Response:**
    * `302 Found`: Redirects to the original long URL if the short code exists in the database.
    * `404 Not Found` (JSON): If the provided short code does not exist.
    ```json
    {
        "error": "URL not found"
    }
    ```

## Database

The application uses an SQLite database named `urls.db` to store the short and long URL mappings. This file will be created in the same directory where you run the application if it doesn't already exist.

## How it Works

1.  When a POST request is made to the `/shorten` endpoint with a long URL, the application generates a random 6-character alphanumeric short code.
2.  It then stores the mapping between the short code and the long URL in the `urls` table in the `urls.db` database.
3.  The application returns a JSON response containing the newly generated short URL.
4.  When a GET request is made to a short URL (e.g., `/abcdef`), the application queries the database for the corresponding long URL.
5.  If a match is found, it performs an HTTP redirect (status code 302) to the original long URL.
6.  If no match is found, it returns a 404 error with a JSON message.

## Potential Improvements

* **Custom Short Codes:** Allow users to specify a custom short code.
* **URL Validation:** Implement more robust validation for the input long URLs.
* **Analytics:** Track the number of clicks on short URLs.
* **Scalability:** For a production environment, consider using a more scalable database and deployment options.
* **Error Handling:** Implement more specific and informative error handling.
* **Security:** Add measures to prevent abuse and malicious use.
